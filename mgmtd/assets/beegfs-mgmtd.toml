# BeeGFS management service configuration file
#
# This file configures the BeeGFS management node and can be used as an alternative or together with
# command line arguments. Command line arguments overwrite arguments specified here,
# arguments specified here overwrite the internal defaults.
#
# The command line help might have more information on a specific setting. Run the management
# binary with `--help` to display it.


# Managements database file location.
# db-file = "/var/lib/beegfs/mgmtd.sqlite"

# The log target to use (valid are "journald", "std").
# log-target = "journald"

# The log level to use (valid are "error", "warn", "info", "debug", "trace").
# log-level = "warn"


### Connection ###

# Sets the BeeMsg / "classic" port (TCP and UDP) to listen on.
# beemsg-port = 8008

# Sets the gRPC port to listen on.
# grpc-port = 8010

# Disables TLS for gRPC communication.
# tls-disable = false

# The PEM encoded .X509 certificate file that provides the identity of the gRPC server.
# tls-cert-file = "/etc/beegfs/cert.pem"

# The private key file belonging to the above certificate.
# tls-key-file = "/etc/beegfs/key.pem"

# Restricts network interfaces reported to other nodes for incoming BeeMsg communication.
# Can be specified multiple times. If not given, all suitable interfaces can be used.
# interfaces = ["eth0", "eth1"]

# Maximum number of outgoing connections per node.
# connection-limit = 12

# Disables requiring authentication (BeeMsg and gRPC).
# auth-disable = false

# The authentication file location.
# auth-file = "/etc/beegfs/conn.auth"


### Generic ###

# Disables registration of new nodes and targets (clients excluded).
# registration-disable = false

# Defines after which time without contact a node/target is considered offline.
# IMPORTANT: This setting must be the same on all nodes in the system, especially when using
# mirroring.
# node-offline-timeout = "180s"

# Defines after which time without contact a client is considered gone and will be removed.
# client-auto-remove-timeout = "30m"

# Disables loading the license library. This disables all enterprise features.
# license-disable = false

# The BeeGFS license certificate file.
# license-cert-file = "/etc/beegfs/license.pem"

# The BeeGFS license library file.
# license-lib-file = "/opt/beegfs/lib/libbeegfs_license.so"


### Quota ###

# Enables quota data collection and checks.
# Allows querying the state and setting limits (which do nothing without enforcement being enabled).
# Causes higher system load.
# quota-enable = false

# Enables quota enforcement.
# Exceeded IDs are calculated and pushed to the servers on a regular basis. Requires quota_enable =
# true. Causes higher system load.
# quota-enforce = false

# Update interval of quota information.
# Defines how often the management pulls the quota information from all storage nodes, calculates
# the IDs that exceed the limits and reports them back to the server nodes.
# quota-update-interval = 30

# The following options specify the User/Group IDs to be fetched from storage services for quota
# checking and enforcement. They are disabled by default and least one needs to be enabled for
# quota enforcement having any effect. They can be mixed.

# Defines the minimum id of the existing system users to be quota checked and enforced.
# Note that this uses the users from the local machine the management is running on.
# quota-user-system-ids-min = 1000

# Loads the user ids to be quota queried and enforced from a file.
# Ids must be numeric only and separated by any whitespace.
# quota-user-ids-file = ""

# Defines a range of user ids to be quota queried and enforced.
# quota-user-ids-range = "1000-1100"

# Same as above, but for group IDs

# quota-group-system-ids-min = 1000
# quota-group-ids-file = ""
# quota-group-ids-range = "1000-1100"


### Capacity pools ###

# which limits shall be used.
